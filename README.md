# RBFS CLI Yang Models

This repository contains the collected Yang model files of the RBFS CLI. It
can be used to access them (maybe for the purpose of automation) without
having to use a virtual RBFS container or install RBFS on a hardware device.

The same files are also available in the `rtbrick-rbfs-cli-yang-models` Ubuntu
package. Please refer to the [RBFS and Tools Installation, and RBFS Licensing Guide](https://documents.rtbrick.com/current/tools/rbfs_tools_installation_and_licensing_guide_online.html) for
information about how to obtain access to that package.
